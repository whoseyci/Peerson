# Peerson

A wholesome app for shared households. Track your pantry, split expenses, assign tasks, and manage a smart shopping list — together.

## Features

- **Households** — Create a household and invite others via a shareable link or 8-digit code.
- **Pantry / Inventory** — Track items with quantities, locations, expiry dates (MHD), and barcodes.
- **Smart Shopping List** — Manually add items or let the app auto-suggest low-stock pantry items.
- **Task Assignment** — Create tasks, assign them to household members, set due dates.
- **Expense & Income Splitting** — Log who paid what and split costs equally among members. Balances are calculated automatically.
- **Monochrome Design** — Clean, accessible UI with dark mode support.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla TypeScript + Vite (SPA, PWA-ready)
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Pages Functions (Workers)
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **Deploy:** GitHub Actions → Cloudflare Pages

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Cloudflare account
- `wrangler` CLI installed globally: `npm install -g wrangler`

### 2. Create D1 Database

```bash
wrangler d1 create peerson-db
```

Copy the `database_id` from the output and paste it into `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "peerson-db"
database_id = "your-database-id-here"
```

### 3. Initialize Schema

```bash
wrangler d1 execute peerson-db --file=./schema.sql
```

### 4. Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For full local dev with Functions + D1:

```bash
npx wrangler pages dev dist --d1=DB
```

### 5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

#### Option A: GitHub Actions (Auto-deploy)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In your Cloudflare dashboard, create a Pages project and connect it to this repo.
3. Set these secrets in your GitHub repo (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — Create one at https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens with "Cloudflare Pages:Edit" and "Account:Read" permissions.
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — Found on the right sidebar of your Cloudflare dashboard.
4. Every push to `main` will auto-deploy.

#### Option B: Manual Deploy

```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=peerson
```

### 6. Bind D1 to Pages Project

After the first deploy, go to your Cloudflare Pages project settings:
- **Settings → Functions → D1 database bindings**
- Add a binding named `DB` pointing to your `peerson-db` database.
- Redeploy if needed.

### 7. (Optional) In-app bug reporting

The "🐛" button lets users file a bug report without leaving the app or
needing a GitHub account — it's handled entirely server-side by
`functions/api/bug-report.ts`. To enable it:

1. Create a **fine-grained GitHub Personal Access Token** scoped only to
   this repo, with **Issues: Read & write** and **Contents: Read & write**
   permissions (Contents is only needed so screenshots can be committed
   into `bug-reports/` and rendered inline — GitHub strips `data:` URI
   images from issue bodies, so a raw committed file is the only way to
   get an inline screenshot to actually show up).
2. In your Cloudflare Pages project: **Settings → Environment variables**,
   add `GITHUB_PAT` as an **encrypted/secret** variable (for both
   Production and Preview environments) with that token as its value.
3. (Optional) If you forked this repo, also set `GITHUB_REPO` to
   `your-username/your-repo` — it defaults to `whoseyci/Peerson`.
4. Redeploy. If `GITHUB_PAT` isn't set, the bug button still works — it
   falls back to opening a pre-filled GitHub "new issue" page in a new
   tab instead of submitting automatically.

**Never** put this token in `wrangler.toml`, a `[vars]` block, or any
client-side code — those are all bundled/committed in plaintext. It must
only ever live as an encrypted Pages environment variable, read
server-side inside a Function.

## Usage

1. Open the app and enter your name.
2. Create a household or join one via invite code/link.
3. Use the bottom dock to switch between:
   - **Vorrat** — Manage pantry items and stock.
   - **Einkaufen** — Shopping list with auto-suggestions for low stock.
   - **Aufgaben** — Assign and track household tasks.
   - **Finanzen** — Split expenses and see who owes what.
   - **Haushalt** — Invite members, copy invite link, toggle dark mode.

## Notes

- No passwords or complex auth — just your name and household membership.
- All data is stored in Cloudflare D1 and synced across devices in real-time.
- The app works great as a mobile PWA. Add it to your home screen!
